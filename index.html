							Located on the south side of San Antonio, TX, KIPP UPrep is a public charter school that serves
							predominantly low-income students. It's claim to fame: <b>the IB Program.</b>
							<br>
							<br>
							Once a standardized curriculum for elite boarding schools,
							International Baccalaureate (IB) provides college-level courses to high school students across the world.
							KIPP UPrep is one of the world's only low-income-serving high schools that enrolls students, <b>by default</b>, in the IB program.
							<br>
							<br>
							In a normal year, students complete coursework, a major project, and sit for a culminating IB exam.
							But 2020 was, of course, different. Unable to administer exams due to COVID, the IB
							program <b>instead used an algorithm to assign each student a final score.</b>

									IB scores are assessed on a 1-7 scale. If a student scores a <b> 4 or higher, they earn college credit.</b>
									In a normal year, every IB class has a project and an exam (each graded on the same 1-7 scale) that
									count towards their final grade. In addition, teachers assign students a predicted grade (also 1-7)
									that doesn't affect student scores.
									<br>
									<br>
									In 2020, <b> IB cancelled its exams. </b> Instead, the program used an algorithm to impute student final scores from the projects
									(which had already been submitted), teacher predicted grades, and historic data.
									<br>
									<br>
									Globally, the algorithm was "kind" to students, boosting scores on average. However,
									at KIPP, <b> scores were lower.</b> Were the 2020 KIPP students lower-performing,
									or did the algorithm hurt their scores?

									Let's explore if the lack of an exam hurt KIPP students more than the general global population.
									Using the 2019 KIPP data, the graphic to the right displays the <b>top 5 courses in which KIPP students most frequently
									earned exam scores above their project and predicted grades.</b> This means these five subjects
									are ones in which KIPP students most frequently do better than expected on the exam.

									Does losing the opportunity to sit for an exam in these subjects explain the 2020 overall decline
									in scores at KIPP?

										<h5>Across performance levels, the algorithm hurt KIPP students - especially in subjects
											with good exam scores.</h5>
										<p>
											<br>
											In 2020, across the score distribution, <b>far fewer students received scores higher
											than their project/predicted grades.</b> In addition, more students received scores
											below their project/predicted grades. Filtering by
											courses with typically high exam scores magnifies the trend.
											<br>
											<br>
											Unlike their high-income peers, low-income students often can't
											afford the help of a tutor. They often struggle to complete projects while working full time.
											So, their project grades are low. The exam
											provides them a better opportunity to show their learning.
											Although a failing project grade is a good predictor of failing the exam for wealthy students
											- <b>at KIPP, a failing project grade is the norm, but some students still crush the exam.</b>
											The algorithm, unfortunately, could not pick up this nuance. <b>It imputed scores based on the global curve.</b>
											KIPP students' scores suffered.

										There seems to be bias when comparing a school that serves predominantly low-income
										students (KIPP) to other IB schools. Yet, algorithmic bias between students <b>within
										the same school</b> may also be a concern. So, we investigated.
										<br>
										<br>
										However, when slicing the data within KIPP by gender, race-ethnicity, and economic
										disadvantage status, there are <b>no clear biases</b> across years.
										This may be why we haven't seen many news stories about IB's algorithm. It's easy for
										students and families to compare scores within schools (where there's no evidence of bias).
										It's much harder to compare results between schools - where there is clear reason for
